## Overview


This is an implementation of a weight-balanced binary tree data
 structure based on the following references:

    and Kazuhiko Yamamoto using the revised non-variant algorithm recommended
    integer balance parameters from (Hirai/Yamomoto 2011).

## Features

Some unique features of a weight-balanced binary-tree as compared with
other binary tree algorithms:


- Less frequent rebalancing as compared to height-balanced
  implementations such as red-black or avl trees.

- Logarithmic rank/at-rank indexed element access.


This particular implementation also provides additional useful
qualities such as lazy traversal, partial enumeration, universal order,
and search for a given key in only d comparisons (where d is depth of
tree) rather than the traditional compare/low compare/high which takes
on average (* 1.5 (- d 1)) comparisons.  In addition, a comprehensive
functional binary tree api provides a rich collection of tools
for the creation of efficient higher-order data structures.

indespensible.
